# Despark-JS-Task

This mini-app consists of a listing and a detail view of list of articles using for starter kit [React Slingshot](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot.git)

## Get Started
1. **Run the setup script**. `npm install`
2. **Run the app**. `npm start -s` - 
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. This command will continue watching all files. Every time we hit save the code is rebuilt and linting runs. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
3. **Automated production build** - Type `npm run build`
